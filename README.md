Login details:
Current built-in users are "punsach," "kaitholz," and "wustl330"
The "punsach" user already has one of each file type (.jpg, .csv, .txt, and .pdf) in it, if you wish to test viewability


### Creative Portion ###

We added the ability to add new custom users at the login page. It adds a line to the users.txt file and creates a fully functional user.

In addition to that, we created a sharing capability, where users can choose a file and type in the name of the (valid) user with whom they wish to share it.
